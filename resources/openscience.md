# Open Science Introduction, Discussion & General Resources

**[Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)** is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA) will begin with an introduction to open principles followed by a discussion on the perceived barriers to researching openly and then break down those barriers by presenting the benefits of open science to both science and researchers.

On this page, we are seeking contributions for the introduction, discussion and resources for this open science toolkit.
