Welcome to the **Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA)** ‚ú® üî≠  project webpage! ROSA is an open project to compile and tailor open science best practices from around the web into a how-to kit for astronomers to research openly from proposal to publication. Please note that this webpage is therefore under construction üë∑‚Äç

The project will result in two products,
* a general open science resource kit that can be adapted to any field,
* and one specifically tailored for astronomy: ROSA.

ROSA was born out of [Round 4](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-4/projects/#resources-for-open-science-in-astronomy-rosa) of the [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) program. The project is being developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/rainsworth/ROSA) so that anyone can contribute content, resources, tutorials, insight and experience, which will undergo curation and tailoring to create field-specific guides. The end product aims to be a well-documented guide on ***why*** you should research openly ***how***.
