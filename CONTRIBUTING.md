# Contributing to ROSA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ROSA :tada:! 

ROSA aims to work with the wider community of astronomers and open science enthusiasts to develop an open science resource kit (tailored for astronomy but open for anyone from any field to adapt) to early career researchers in order to empower them with the tools to practice open science/access/data/source/research/workflow from the very start.
