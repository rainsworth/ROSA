## Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA)


**Welcome to the ROSA community, we are very happy to have you!** 

Our mission is to compile and tailor open science best practices from around the web into a resource kit for astronomers to work openly from proposal to publication. ROSA will be written for use by all research levels but our main goal is to supply a single resource to empower early career scientists with the tools to practice open access/data/source/science!

We envision that this project will result in two products: a general open science resource kit that can be adapted to any field, and one specifically tailored for astronomy: ROSA. The end product aims to be a well-documented guide on ***why*** you should research openly and ***how***.


Below you will find our roadmap where you can investigate the issues that you can contribute to. Please check out our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you get started, and read more about our vision in the [README](README.md)!

### Milestones

#### September 2017

- [x] Set up GitHub repository for the project 
	- [x] Write README.md 
	- [x] Write CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md 
	- [x] Write ROADMAP.md
	- [x] Write CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Promote project to wider astronomy community via social media channels to attract contributors
	- [x] [Astrotweeps](https://twitter.com/astrotweeps)
	- [ ] [Astronomers Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/123898011017097/) 
	- [ ] Create simple email survey/poll about what researchers would like to request or suggest for the kit
- [x] Set up gitter for project
- [ ] Establish acknowledgement system to empower contributors


#### October 2017

- [ ] Draft contents for resource toolkit, i.e. what topics do we want the resource kit to cover?
- [ ] Draft content on ***why*** you should research openly (e.g. benefits to both researchers and science) and break down perceived barriers
- [ ] Compile resources, tutorials, platforms, etc. for each of the open research pillars ([FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) is a great place to start)
- [ ] Begin tailoring for astronomy (e.g. for open access: how to publish a preprint to the [astro-ph arXiv](https://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph))
- [ ] Set up GitHub webpage as prototype
- [ ] Working prototype to present and test/get feedback on at [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/)!! (Oct 27-19, session description [here](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/582))

 

#### November 2017 onwards
 
- [ ] Implement feedback from [MozFest session](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/582)
- [ ] Report progress using success metrics (e.g. number of contributors to the project, visitors to the prototype website)
- [ ] Continue to contribute or request content to be added to the kit!
