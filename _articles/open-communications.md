**Before you start this section, make sure you have completed your project README and established an online repository for your work. Also consider the online communication channels your contributors and community members use most often.**

In this section, you'll learn about the importance of open communications to your project and then develop communication channels, or "comms," specific to your project and your community needs including a calendar, online presence (such as a blog), and community call schedule.
