**[Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)** is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

Section 1 of this resource presents an introduction to open principles followed by a discussion on the perceived barriers to researching openly. Finally, we hope to break down those barriers by presenting the benefits of open science to both science and researchers. Section 1 will present ***why*** you should research openly and the remaining sections of ROSA will then show you ***how***.
