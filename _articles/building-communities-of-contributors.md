Leading an open project, realizing a vision, collaborating with smart people to make cool stuff on the web-- this is thrilling, energizing work! And as much as you’re driven by project creation, goals, and aims, in the end working open is really all about relationships: the working relationships you establish with your contributors, how those contributors come together to grow into a community, and how you as a leader can welcome them, and help them feel valued, engaged, and excited by the project. In this module you’ll learn how to build two kinds of communities-- the large, vibrant, ever changing and growing community of open project contributors, and smaller, closer-knit network of people who support your leadership.
