### Intro to Resources for Open Science in Astronomy (ROSA)

ROSA is designed to help you learn best practices in “working open” in astronomy -- practicing science in such a way that:

* **others can collaborate and contribute to the work**
* **research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available on the Internet, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.**


This resource is designed to help researchers in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, at all stages of their career, to work openly from proposal to publication.

This project was started by Dr. Rachael Ainsworth as part of the Mozilla Open Leaders program. ROSA is a response to the challenges researchers face to practicing openly in academia. Astronomy is better at open science than many other fields but there is still a long way to go to make astrophysical research more transparent, reproducible, open and inclusive.

This resource consists of # sections, each containing information on a topic related to working open. The # sections are:

2. [Topic 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/topic-2)
