**Before you start this section, you'll need to have an established online project and community communication channels you can use to bring contributors together for a face-to-face (F2F) event such as a work sprint or hack jam.**

In the section, you'll learn how to design your event for accessibility, inclusivity, and openness. You'll also learn how to facilitate the learning and logistics at your event. Finally, you'll develop plans for following up with participants after your event and for documenting and reporting what you accomplished there.
