As you learned in a previous section, GitHub is a web-based interface for version control. To review, version control is a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub also provides an excellent set of collaborative tools as well as structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. You’ve already got your project set up on Github in the previous section, in this section you’ll establish a good workflow to create a respectful and productive environment for your collaborators.

First, you’ll learn a bit more about how repositories are shared, stored, and updated on GitHub. You’ll learn about GitHub-specific concepts related to making those changes: branches, pull requests, merges, forks, and issues. And you’ll get some practice managing and making changes to a repository.
