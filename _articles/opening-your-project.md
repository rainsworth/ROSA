This section is designed help you clarify and communicate your project idea, purpose and goals in a way that will invite and encourage participation from your community. This is a first step if you’re opening up a brand new project, but you can also use these exercises to refocus an open project that’s stalled or stuck. You’ll expand your project vision statement into a more detailed description, strategy, and plan for upcoming work. These documents will serve as a  “welcome mat” for your project, a clear way for newcomers to quickly understand what the project is about, who can be involved, and where the work is headed.
