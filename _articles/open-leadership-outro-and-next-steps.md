**Before you begin this section, gather together the offline and online materials and documentation you've assembled over the course of your project.**

In this section, you'll consider open leadership advice from community organizers, expert facilitators, and veterans of working and leading in the open. After that, you'll have the chance to compose and share your own open leadership reflection on what you and your community have made and learned together over the course of Mozilla's Open Leadership Training Series.
