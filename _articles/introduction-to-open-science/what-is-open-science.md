### What is Open Science?

**Open Science** is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, codes and other research outputs are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods. In other words, Open Science means making every step of your research process freely available on the Internet in a way that allows anyone to access and use it - promoting collaboration, reproducibility, transparency and inclusion!

Open Science is an umbrella term for many "open" philosophies and models with the common motivations of sharing freely, preventing duplication, avoiding restrictive (copyright) practices, promoting economic efficiencies and improving access to wide groups of stakeholders.

* **Open Access** is free, online access to scientific content (such as peer reviewed publications) with limited copyright and licensing restrictions. An example of this in astrophysics is depositing a version of your manuscript on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

* **Open Data** is free, online access to data that allows it to be used, reused and distributed provided that the data source is cited. For example, astronomical catalogues and data tables can be published to [VizieR](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/).

* **Open Source** Software where the source code is freely available online, with terms that allow dissemination and adaptation. The [astropy](https://github.com/astropy) project on [GitHub](https://github.com/) is an example of open source software in astronomy.

* **Open Educational Resources** are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use - for example, THIS resource!

Open Science also encompasses citizen science (where the general public participates in scientific research such as [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/)), and promotes equity, diversity and inclusion through making research outputs accessible to all.
